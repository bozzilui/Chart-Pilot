# Chart Pilot

Chart pilot is a simple stock charting application built using flask and dash.

I created this application so that creating charts for your stocks can all be done seamlessly.

To get started, you may copy this repo to your own computer and install the needed requirements
Then simply run the run.py file and the app will be hosted on a local server (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050).
